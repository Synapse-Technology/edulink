## Internship Lifecycle Blueprint: Completion & Certification

### **1. Pre-Completion Requirements (The "Musts")**

Before an internship can be transitioned to `COMPLETED` status, the following conditions **must** be met to ensure academic integrity and administrative closure:

1. **No Pending Reviews:**

   * **Rule:** There must be zero logbooks/evidence with a status of `SUBMITTED` or `REVIEWED` (waiting for second approval). All evidence must be resolved to either `ACCEPTED` or `REJECTED`.

   * **Reason:** Prevents "orphaned" work that is never graded.
2. **Minimum Evidence Threshold:**

   * **Rule:** At least one piece of evidence (e.g., Weekly Logbook) must be `ACCEPTED`.

   * **Reason:** Ensures the student actually participated.
3. **Final Supervisor Evaluation:**

   * **Rule:** Both Employer and Institution Supervisors must submit a **Final Assessment**.

   * **Reason:** This is the qualitative "grade" for the internship.

### **2. Post-Completion State (The "Frozen" State)**

Once the status is `COMPLETED`:

* **Immutable History:**

  * **NO** new logbooks/evidence can be submitted by the student.

  * **NO** existing evidence can be reviewed or modified by supervisors.

  * **NO** changes to supervisor assignments.

* **Allowed Actions (The "Dos"):**

  * **Read-Only Access:** Students and supervisors can view all past logs and feedback.

  * **Certification:** The Institution Admin can proceed to `CERTIFY` the internship (issuing the final grade/credits).

  * **Export:** Generate a PDF report of the entire internship history.

### **3. Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Backend Logic Updates**

1. **Update** **`ApplicationWorkflow.transition`** **(or** **`complete_internship`** **service):**

   * Add check: \`if application.evidence.filter(status\_\_in=\['SUBMITTED', 'REVIEWED']).exists(): raise
