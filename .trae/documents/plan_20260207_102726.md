# Lightweight Scalability & Seamless UX Plan

To ensure the platform remains responsive and scalable without heavy infrastructure like Redis or Kafka, we will implement a tiered "lightweight" optimization strategy.

## **1. Backend Scalability & Resilience**
### **API Throttling**
- Implement **DRF Throttling** to prevent single users from overwhelming the backend.
- Define separate rates for anonymous users (strict) and authenticated users (lenient).

### **Lightweight Background Tasks**
- Integrate **Django-Q2** with the **PostgreSQL database** as the message broker.
- Offload non-critical tasks (Email sending, Ledger recording, PDF generation) to background workers.
- *Benefit*: This avoids making the user wait for "slow" operations while keeping infrastructure minimal.

### **Query Optimization Audit**
- Audit core views ([InternshipViewSet](file:///c:/Users/bouri/Documents/Projects/Edulink/edulink/apps/internships/views.py), [StudentViewSet](file:///c:/Users/bouri/Documents/Projects/Edulink/edulink/apps/students/views.py)) to ensure `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are used correctly to prevent N+1 query overhead.

## **2. Seamless UX & Real-time Integration**
### **Managed Real-time (Pusher)**
- Integrate **Pusher** (managed service) for instant notifications.
- *Scenarios*: New support ticket replies, internship application status changes, and system-wide alerts.
- *Benefit*: No need to manage complex WebSocket servers or horizontal scaling for sockets.

### **Frontend State Management (TanStack Query)**
- Introduce **TanStack Query** to the frontend.
- *Features*: Intelligent caching, background revalidation, and optimistic updates.
- *Benefit*: Navigation becomes near-instant as data is cached locally, and API requests are significantly reduced.

## **3. Implementation Steps**
1. **Backend**: Install `django-q2`, configure throttling in `base.py`.
2. **Backend**: Refactor `services.py` across apps to use `async_task` for slow operations.
3. **Frontend**: Install `@tanstack/react-query` and wrap the application.
4. **Integration**: Set up Pusher channels for real-time events.
