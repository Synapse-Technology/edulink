## Internship Certification Blueprint

### **1. Authority & Roles**
*   **Who Certifies?** The **Institution Admin** (University/College) acts as the sole certifying authority.
    *   *Why?* Certification implies academic credit or official recognition. While the employer confirms the work was done (Completion), only the university can validate it for academic purposes.
*   **Employer's Role:** Their job ends at **Completion** (marking the project done and providing feedback). They cannot "Certify".

### **2. The Workflow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Completion Phase (Operational End)**
    *   **Action:** Employer Supervisor marks internship as `COMPLETED`.
    *   **Prerequisites:** All logbooks reviewed, Final Feedback submitted.
    *   **Result:** Student work stops. Status becomes `COMPLETED`.

2.  **Certification Phase (Academic Approval)**
    *   **Action:** Institution Admin reviews the `COMPLETED` internship (checking feedback, logbooks, and hours).
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If satisfied: Clicks **"Issue Certificate"** (Transitions to `CERTIFIED`).
        *   If not: Can revert to `ACTIVE` or contact supervisor (Manual process).
    *   **Result:** Status becomes `CERTIFIED`.

3.  **Artifact Generation (The Result)**
    *   **Action:** Once status is `CERTIFIED`, the "Download Certificate" button becomes active on the **Student Dashboard**.
    *   **System:** Generates a PDF containing:
        *   Student Name & Reg No.
        *   Employer Name & Duration.
        *   University Seal.
        *   Verification QR Code.

### **3. Implementation Gap Analysis**
*   **Current State:** The backend logic (`certify_internship` restricted to Institution Admin) matches this blueprint perfectly.
*   **Frontend Check:** We need to ensure the **Student Dashboard** only shows the "Download Certificate" button when the status is `CERTIFIED`, not just `COMPLETED`. This adds value to the certification step.

### **4. Action Plan**
1.  **Restrict Certificate Download:** Modify `StudentInternship.tsx` (and backend artifact generator) to allow certificate generation **only** when status is `CERTIFIED` (currently it might allow it at `COMPLETED`).
2.  **Enhance Institution UI:** Ensure the Institution Admin dashboard clearly highlights `COMPLETED` internships that are waiting to be `CERTIFIED`.

This ensures "Certification" means something real: The University has signed off.
