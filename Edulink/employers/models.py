# This model has been consolidated with EmployerProfile in users.models.employer_profile
# to prevent duplicate employer models and data inconsistency.
# All employer functionality should use users.models.EmployerProfile instead.

# If you need to import EmployerProfile, use:
# from users.models.employer_profile import EmployerProfile
