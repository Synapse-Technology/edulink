## Data Model Decisions

### ADR-007: Multi-Role User Model

**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers: Caroline Obuya (Backend Developer), Duncan Mathai (Security Engineer)

#### Context
We needed to support multiple user types (students, employers, institutions, supervisors) with different permissions and data requirements.

#### Decision
We implemented a single User model with role-based profiles using Django's built-in User model as a base.

#### Rationale
- **Flexibility:** Single authentication system for all user types
- **Simplicity:** Easier to manage permissions and relationships
- **Django Integration:** Leverages Django's built-in authentication
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new roles and permissions
- **Data Integrity:** Consistent user data across the system

#### Alternatives Considered

   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns
   - Cons: Complex authentication, difficult cross-role relationships
   - Rejected: Too complex for authentication and permissions

2. **Abstract User Model**
   - Pros: Complete control over user fields
   - Cons: Breaks compatibility with Django ecosystem
   - Rejected: Would complicate third-party package integration

#### Implementation Details
```python
class User(AbstractUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)
    is_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    
class StudentProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    student_id = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    institution = models.ForeignKey(Institution, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
class EmployerProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    company_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    industry = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Unified authentication, flexible permissions, easier relationships
- **Negative:** Potential for unused fields, complex profile management
- **Mitigation:** Use profile models to separate role-specific data

**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** Mark Matheka (Data Engineer), Caroline Obuya (Backend Developer)

#### Context
We needed to handle data deletion while maintaining referential integrity and audit trails.

#### Decision
We implemented a soft delete pattern using a `deleted_at` field and custom managers.

#### Rationale
- **Data Recovery:** Ability to recover accidentally deleted data
- **Audit Trail:** Maintain complete history of data changes
- **Referential Integrity:** Avoid cascade deletion issues
- **Analytics:** Preserve data for historical analysis
- **Compliance:** Meet data retention requirements

#### Implementation Details
```python
class SoftDeleteManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(deleted_at__isnull=True)

class BaseModel(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    objects = SoftDeleteManager()
    all_objects = models.Manager()
    
    def delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):
        self.deleted_at = timezone.now()
        self.save(using=using)
    
    def hard_delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):
        super().delete(using=using, keep_parents=keep_parents)
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Data recovery, audit trails, referential integrity
- **Negative:** Increased storage requirements, query complexity
- **Mitigation:** Implement data archiving and cleanup processes

```python
class Role(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    permissions = models.ManyToManyField(Permission)
    description = models.TextField()

class UserRole(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.ForeignKey(Role, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    assigned_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    assigned_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='assigned_roles')

# Custom permissions
class InternshipPermission(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if request.user.role == 'employer':
            return request.method in ['GET', 'POST']
        elif request.user.role == 'student':
            return request.method in ['GET']
        return False
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Flexible, scalable, secure access control
- **Negative:** Complexity in permission management
- **Mitigation:** Implement role management interface and clear documentation

**Status:** Accepted  
  
**Decision Makers:** Duncan Mathai (Security Engineer), Caroline Obuya (Backend Developer)

#### Context
We needed to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage across all users.

#### Decision
We implemented rate limiting using django-ratelimit and DRF throttling.

#### Rationale
- **Security:** Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse
- **Performance:** Ensures system stability under load
- **Fair Usage:** Prevents single users from monopolizing resources
- **Cost Control:** Reduces infrastructure costs from excessive usage

#### Implementation Details
```python
# API throttling
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/hour',
        'user': '1000/hour',
        'login': '5/minute',
    }
}

# View-level rate limiting
from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='5/m', method='POST')
def login_view(request):
    # Login logic
    pass
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Better security, system stability, fair usage
- **Negative:** May limit legitimate high-volume usage

@cache_page(60 * 15)  # Cache for 15 minutes
def internship_list(request):
    # View logic
    pass

# Model-level caching
from django.core.cache import cache

class InternshipService:
    def get_featured_internships(self):
        cache_key = 'featured_internships'
        internships = cache.get(cache_key)
        
        if internships is None:
            internships = Internship.objects.filter(
                is_featured=True
            ).select_related('employer')
            cache.set(cache_key, internships, 60 * 30)  # 30 minutes
